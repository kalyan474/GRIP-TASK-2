                                                           MACHINE LEARNING MODEL

TO EXPLORE SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING MODEL
In this regression model we have to predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. 
It is a simple regression task with two variables. 
In this model particularly I have predicted score if student study for 9.25 Hrs day.
